## Lessons Learned

Like in my previous project, all the components were made using JavaScript.

This project taught me use of classes and constructors ( which I had a little knowledge of from Java ).
I used many functions, functions on events, switch cases, for loops which I have now a good grasp of. I also learned to add sound. I must say game dev is fun.

To be honest it wasn't all that complicated when I look at it now, knowing what's going on but at the beginning I didn't even know where to start.
What this project gave me the most is a perspective of 'programming thinking', that is, how to tackle problems and most importantly, ask questions when stuck.
There's a whole lot you have to consider when coding, that usually you don't think of. 
"How to make a ball move", "How to hide boxes on hit" etc. A realization of need of different approach to thinking.
This project is mostly to show that I understand what's going on and progress further, as I followed a tutorial. I did as much as I could by myself, but this being the first "big" project I did in JS, it wouldn't be possible without help.
